## Technical Requirements

### UI Components

1. Scene Display
```typescript
interface SceneDisplayProps {
  scene: Scene;
  onSceneComplete: () => void;
  streamingEnabled: boolean;
}
```

2. Choice Interface
```typescript
interface ChoiceProps {
  choice: Choice;
  onSelect: (id: number) => void;
  disabled: boolean;
}
```

3. Game Controls
```typescript
interface GameControlsProps {
  onSave: () => void;
  onLoad: () => void;
  onCheckpoint: () => void;
  hasCheckpoint: boolean;
}
```

### State Management

```typescript
interface VersionedState extends GameState {
  version: string;
  lastModified: string;
}

interface GameState {
  currentScene: Scene;
  history: GameHistoryEntry[];
  gameOver: boolean;
  checkpoint?: {
    scene: Scene;
    history: GameHistoryEntry[];
    timestamp: string;
    version?: string;
    metadata?: any;
  };
  version?: string;
  metadata?: any;
}
```

### API Integration

```typescript
interface OpenAIStreamCallbacks {
  onToken: (token: string) => void;
  onComplete: (choices: Choice[]) => void;
  onError: (error: Error) => void;
}

interface OpenAIConfig {
  model: string;
  temperature: number;
  maxTokens: number;
  presencePenalty: number;
  frequencyPenalty: number;
  metadata?: {
    costPer1kTokens?: number;
    recommended?: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scene Generation
- Scenes must be coherent and contextually relevant
- Response streaming must be smooth
- Error handling must be robust
- Choices must be logical, varied, and specific to the scene
- No generic choices like "Investigate further"
- Each choice should lead to a distinct narrative path

### State Management
- Game state must persist correctly
- Checkpoints must be reliable
- State rollback must work perfectly
- Auto-save must not interfere with gameplay
- State versioning must handle migrations smoothly
- Conflict resolution must preserve data integrity
- State validation must catch invalid states
- Error recovery must handle edge cases

### User Interface
- Must be responsive (mobile-first)
- Must have clear loading states
- Must handle errors gracefully
- Must provide clear feedback
- Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1)
- Must handle streaming content smoothly
- Must provide proper error boundaries

### Performance
- Initial load < 2s
- Scene generation < 5s
- State updates < 100ms
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- State saving < 200ms
- Error recovery < 500ms
