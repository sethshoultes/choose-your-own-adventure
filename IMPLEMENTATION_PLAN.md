## Technical Requirements

### UI Components

1. Scene Display
```typescript
interface SceneDisplayProps {
  scene: Scene;
  onSceneComplete: () => void;
  streamingEnabled: boolean;
}
```

2. Choice Interface
```typescript
interface ChoiceProps {
  choice: Choice;
  onSelect: (id: number) => void;
  disabled: boolean;
}
```

3. Game Controls
```typescript
interface GameControlsProps {
  onSave: () => void;
  onLoad: () => void;
  onCheckpoint: () => void;
  hasCheckpoint: boolean;
}
```

### State Management

```typescript
interface GameState {
  currentScene: Scene;
  history: GameHistoryEntry[];
  gameOver: boolean;
  checkpoint?: {
    scene: Scene;
    history: GameHistoryEntry[];
    timestamp: string;
  };
}
```

### API Integration

```typescript
interface OpenAIConfig {
  model: string;
  temperature: number;
  maxTokens: number;
  presencePenalty: number;
  frequencyPenalty: number;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scene Generation
- Scenes must be coherent and contextually relevant
- Response streaming must be smooth
- Error handling must be robust
- Choices must be logical and varied
